# News Outlet Freedom Detection

There are many news organizations around the world. News organizations play a vital role in relaying important news of home and abroad to its readers. These news often cover incidents that are either positive, negative, or neutral. Moreover, some news stories can be viewed as talking for a country or talking against it. 

A news outlet is free if it can report news in an unbiased manner and free from censorship. In this project, we aim to detect if a local news organization is free. To do so, we compare the sentiment and stance of the organization with international news reporting institutions **Reuters** and **Associated Press**. A news outlet whose news correlates well with these international organizations are deemed as having freedom of press. Meaning, they are free from censorship.
